                <h4><strong>Policy On Recipients.</strong></h4>
                Waiting times vary widely for many reasons. The shortage of organs causes most patients to wait for a transplant. The amount of time a patient waits does not show how well a transplant center or OPO is doing its job. Each patient's situation is different. Some patients are more ill than others when they are put on the transplant waiting list. Some patients get sick more quickly than other patients, or respond differently to treatments. Patients may have medical conditions that make it harder to find a good match for them.

                    How long a patient waits depends on many factors. These can include:

                    blood type (some are rarer than others)
                    tissue type
                    height and weight of transplant candidate
                    size of donated organ
                    medical urgency
                    time on the waiting list
                    the distance between the donor's hospital and the potential donor organ

                <h4><strong>Policy On Patnerships.</strong></h4>
                Mydonor policy on partnership outlines the principles and approaches that are
                fundamental to our programme partnerships. It aims to provide a common
                understanding of’ approach and to promote consistency and coherence
                in our work.
                The focus of this policy is ’ relationships with programme partner
                organisations. Our programme partners include government ministries and
                departments, national and international non-government organisations (NGOs),
                disabled and blind peoples’ organisations (DPOs or BPOs), local community
                organisations and private sector companies. The policy applies to:
                • project-level and strategic-level programme partnerships, which may or may
                not involve the provision of funding;
                • one-to-one programme partnerships and more complex programme
                relationships such as alliances, coalitions and consortia of partner
                organisations.
