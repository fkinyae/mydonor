                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>MYDONOR is an organization established in 5th June 2005 in Nairobi,Kenya.</p>
                <p>Our aim is to donate blood and internal body organs to those that have experienced body organ failure or have lost a lot of blood and require high medical attention.</p>
                <p>The government along with other institutions like hospitals within the country have partnered with our organization inorder to donate blood and certain body organs to recipients within the country who urgently need it.</p>
                <p>Over the past 16 years, we have been focusing our collective capabilities on ensuring that those who need to be donated urgently, we connect them to various donors who are willing to help inorder to uplift their suffering and save their lives.</p>
                <p>In the next 3 years,we aim to have reached out to over a thousand recipients and help solve their lives.</p>
                <h3>Challenges faced</h3>
                <ul class="challenge">
                    <li>Finding organ donors has been a major challenge. </li>
                    <li>At times we are also unable to meet the high demand due to lack of enough donors.</li>
                    <li>Funds have also been a challenge since without the necessary funds,we are unable to keep the organization running well.</li>
